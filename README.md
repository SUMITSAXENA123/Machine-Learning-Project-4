**Project Overview: BMI Tracker App**
**Objective**
**The BMI Tracker App aims to provide users with a simple, intuitive, and efficient way to calculate and track their Body Mass Index (BMI). The primary objectives of the app are to:**
**1. Help users maintain a healthy lifestyle by monitoring their BMI.
2. Provide insights and recommendations based on BMI results.
3. Offer a user-friendly interface for easy data input and result interpretation.**

**Technologies Used**
**The BMI Tracker App is built using Python, leveraging its powerful libraries for data handling, computation, and user interface design. The project is developed and executed within the Jupyter Notebook environment, which allows for interactive and iterative development**

**Python Libraries Utilized**
**The project makes use of several key Python libraries:**
**1. NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
2. Pandas: For handling and processing user data efficiently.
3. Matplotlib: For visualizing BMI trends and results.
4. IPyWidgets: For creating interactive UI elements within Jupyter Notebook.
5. Seaborn: For enhanced data visualization capabilities.**

**Key Features**
**1. BMI Calculation: The core feature of the app is to calculate BMI based on user input of height and weight.
2. BMI Categories: Classifies the calculated BMI into categories such as Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obesity.
3. Data Visualization: Provides graphical representation of BMI trends over time to help users understand their progress.
4. User Interface: An intuitive and interactive interface for data input and result display using IPyWidgets**
